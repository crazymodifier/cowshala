                  <p class="pr-lg-5">The milk is primarily of two different types A1 and A2. This difference is on the basis of protein the milk contains. A1 milk contains beta-casein protein while this protein in absent in A2 milk. Studies suggest that beta-casein protein in milk causes digestive discomforts on consumption. These include bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea and gas. The absence of beta-casein protein in A2 milk makes it the most healthy option.</p>
                  <p> A1 milk is mostly produced by exotic breeds like Jersey and Holstein Friesian and can be availed in abundance. While the A2 milk is produced by mostly the desi breeds and has limited availability. Interesting fact is all the mammals including human being produce A2 milk only. The availability of A1 milk is high in the market as compared to A2 milk, because its production can be managed as per demand by developing A1 protein, which is not possible with A2 protein.</p>

                  <div class="pr-lg-5">
                    <p>Ghee or clarified butter has been a part of Indian food for ages. This relishing milk product has multiple benefits on health. Taking at least a spoonful of Ghee daily is recommended for good digestion, strong immunity, glowing skin and healthy hair.</p>
                    <p>Cowshala has come up with Desi Ghee made by the vedic bilona process. Bilona customarily refers to the traditional method of making ghee. In this elaborate process, milk is boiled, cooled and stored in earthen pot. Then a little amount of curd is added to it and kept at room temperature overnight. The curd is then churned manually to extract butter from it. In the last step, the butter is boiled so that excess water is evaporated and pure ghee can be extracted. </p>
